##The new era of field sampling planning

Deciding where to sample is the most important step in field data collection, as this affects the subsequent data analysis. Soil sampling methods have been discussed extensively. There are theoretical textbooks for sampling. The NRCS and the IAEA provide sampling guidelines. Now there are great R packages for soil sampling decision making.   

Unlike digital data, field data collected in the natural environment is not replicable. If we return to the study site the next day, the conditions will have changed overnight because of precipitation, wind, and possible human and animal disturbance. Temperature and moisture levels will be different. Particularly for soils, once you remove a sample from a location, you can never collect exactly the sample at the same spot again.

Once we obtain our samples and the data, it’s time to analyze them, but how? If our sampling plan and analysis methods are perfectly designed before we walk into the field, that is a plus. But sometimes, we can’t decide what methodology we’ll use until we see the collected data, knowing that we won’t be able to get the same sample again. That is the peril of field sampling.

For example, if I have a 1 km (1000 m) x 1 km (1000 m) study site, and I can take only ten samples because of the time and budget constraints, how should I determine the sampling locations?

1) Random sampling. But how about spatial resolutions?
2) But the land is not flat. Should I use contour lines? How should we configure the sampling locations then?
3) But, water flows. Should we use basin boundaries or water flow directions?
4) And, there are other topographic variables … How should we cover the variable ranges with a limited number of samples?
5) How about the temporal changes of the environment if we are sampling multiple times in the study site?

All these decisions need to be made while considering the constraints of labor, technology, time, and other resources. 

So, what is the best way to sample when the number of samples that we can collect is limited? Each researcher must justify his/her own methodology. For my dissertation samples, I mixed #6 and #8-9. But now I realize that improvements were possible if I had used #10-12 as well.

Whatever the approaches we use, field sampling is like drawing an original painting. We can draw hundreds of different portraits from one subject (research question). We talk a lot about analysis methods, graphics, findings, and so on, but I wish there were more discussions about ‘How to sample?’ With GIS and machine learning, new approaches to sampling are possible. Those new approaches will bring us new insights. This could be a new and exciting era of field sampling.
