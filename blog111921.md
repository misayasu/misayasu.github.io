### Blog 4 (11/19/2021): The Horror of Units

Radiation is a tough topic to discuss and explain. In the book “Three Mile Island,” the author J. Samuel Walker depicted the challenges that nuclear engineers and experts faced explaining radiation hazards to the public, the media, and government officials. One of the reasons was the radioactivity units.

When we try to understand scientific data, one thing that frustrates us is the units of measurement. While units might be just irritants in school exams, understanding units is a serious matter for radioactive contamination. How can we assess a situation when there are multiple definitions for ‘radiation'–exposure, absorption, inhalation, ingestion, touching, and we are unsure what the expert is talking about?  After how long and how often does the radiation become ‘dangerous? 

Each industry and country has specific rules to express radiation. The United States’ love for non-SI units doesn’t help this situation.

Here are some of the conversion examples between the numbers related to the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident and the radiation regulations in the U.S.

Nowadays, we can convert these numbers using online calculators and computer programs (although still painful). But those simple conversions do not help much when we are worried about whether we need to evacuate when, how far, how long, and when we wonder if any adverse health effects might occur ten, twenty, thirty years later.

So, what can we do to make these radiation readings more understandable for the public? There are a couple of options.

- Use categorical descriptions for radiation hazards with timelines. Maybe we can use a coding system like METAR (METeorological Aerodrome Reports).
--e.g., [Safe, today, steady], [Safe, next 3 days], [Moderate Risk, momentarily, rising], [High Risk, now, long-term not determined], [High Risk, passed 2 hours ago, long-term safe], [Await Announcements, next 24 hours, steady], [Evacuation, possible in the next 24 hours], etc. 

- Use relative scales
o	e.g., 2.0 µSv/h below the concern level, 10 mRem above the hourly threshold, 25% below risk level, 10% above reading yesterday, accumulated 20% of the yearly limit, etc.

- Add personal situations
o	e.g., [Safe (adults), today, steady, adults, rising]&[Stay Inside (pregnant women, infants), rising], [Low Risk(off-premise), next 24 hours, steady]&[Median Risk(on-premise), next 24 hours, 30% yearly limit, rising], [Await Announcements (mobile citizen), next 2 days, fluctuation]&[ Evacuation Stand-by (seniors, disabled), next 2  days, fluctuation], etc.

This inconsistent data issue is not only for the units. The nuclear industry has accumulated considerable data from nuclear research, nuclear incidents, and accidents in the last half-century. But a comprehensive and standardized system of defining, storing, relating, comparing, and analyzing the accumulated data is surprisingly scarce. If those systems exist, they are partial or private databases hidden from the public. If you have tried to collect information about a nuclear incident, radiation hazards, radiation regulations, you know that it is difficult to obtain.

Nuclear energy is being re-recognized as an energy source that emits less CO2. However, if we are to foster reasonable debates about nuclear energy and not typical emotional discussion, it is necessary to standardize nuclear-related data and make this systematized data globally accessible.
