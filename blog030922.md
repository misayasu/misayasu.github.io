### Blog 5 (03/09/2022): Fukushima to Ukraine

It’s 11 years since the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) accident. Who imagined at that time that the accident would eventually lead to a war in Ukraine?
Some countries became concerned about the safety of nuclear energy generation because of the FDNPP accident and decided to pause their nuclear plants temporarily for safety checks (e.g., Japan) or decided to decommission those plants entirely, moving toward renewable energy generation (e.g., Germany). In the case of Europe, that move increased their reliance on natural gas exports from Russia. Ukraine became heavily entangled in this energy-security battle. The background of this battle is well summarized in a <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11138" target="_blank">US Congressional Research Service report</a>, although the country’s geopolitical tug-of-war has centuries of history.

Many countries have been working on the transition from fossil fuel energy to renewable energy even before the FDNPP accident. But that accident accelerated the transition plans, adding denuclearization to those plans resulting in energy insecurity in the process, at least in some countries. Even if the FDNPP accident had not occurred, countries would have proceeded along similar transition paths, however at a slower pace, moving from a phase to phase, ensuring that the countries’ energy securities were not compromised.
Due to recent Ukraine events, some argue that we need to accelerate green energy conversion to avoid future conflicts over fossil fuel energy resources or natural gas. Others argue that we should restart nuclear plants that we shut down after the FDNPP accident as a non-fossil fuel source energy with less CO2 emissions. These proponents claim that the nuclear accident risk is negligible.

Setting aside those arguments motivated by the war, in general, the media and comments on social media have supported the renewable energy transition from two perspectives: less CO2 emissions and risk aversion from nuclear energy. Can our energy future be bright with renewables and nuclear? Reality is not that straightforward. Simplified arguments (CO2 and risks) about the energy transition could lead to haste and ill-informed decision-making by the public and the policymakers. 

Nuclear energy policy researchers dig deep into the complex background of the position of nuclear energy in society. Here I attempt to summarize the factors that we need to consider when discussing the energy transition.

1. Resource Aspects
- Natural resources (volume and distance)
- Resource procurement ability (financial, transportation)
- Operational resource availability (water, electricity, fuel, etc.)

2. Infrastructure Aspect
- Available feasible locations for a facility 
- Temporal ranges of construction and closing
- Costs of construction and operation
- Transportation for construction materials and workforce

3. Technological Aspects
- Availability of technology (current, future)
- Workforce availability and workforce skills
- Energy transportation (grids)
- Technological and physical upgrade possibilities 
- Probability and severity of risks humans and to the environment
- Temporal and spatial ranges of possible risks

4. Financial Aspects
- Costs of infrastructure construction and operation
- Cost-benefit analysis on energy source conversion

5. Social Aspects
- Public support
- Governmental support
- External factors (government policy changes, conflicts, etc.)

6. Energy Future Aspects
- Capacity, durability, and reliability as an energy source (continuous natural resource availability, site stability, infrastructure durability, social stability, etc.)

7. Decommissioning or closing (not only nuclear power plants but also green energy plants)
- Costs of facility closing and clean-up (disposing of, storage, recycling)
- Availability of technology and space for decommissioning
- Impact of decommissioning on environment 
- Impact of decommissioning to local communities
- Availability of alternative energy source

Additional factors are not covered here.

The current event unfolding in Ukraine has renewed energy resource discussions. Societies can’t function on unstable or frail energy sources. Societies need to weigh the risk; even it’s a 0.001% chance that the risk might result in the devastation of an area in the absolute worst-case scenario. We need to step back and evaluate so that we will not provoke another war because of hasty or misguided decisions on energy policies.
